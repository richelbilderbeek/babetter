Description: 'babette' (<https://github.com/ropensci/babette>) 
  is an R package to call 'BEAST2' (<http://www.beast2.org>) 
  from R. 'BEAST2' is a widely used
  Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
  and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated.
  Because 'BEAST2' is very flexible, 'babette' needs to be flexible
  as well. This package tests 'babette' under a wide range of options,
  that are too time-consuming to add to the 'babette' tests.
